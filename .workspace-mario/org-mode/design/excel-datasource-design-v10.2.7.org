Excel Datasource Implementation Analysis

After reviewing the provided code, I think modeling the Excel file datasource implementation on the existing CSV implementation is an excellent approach. Here's why:

Advantages of Mimicking the CSV Implementation

    Similar Logical Structure: Both CSV and Excel are tabular data formats with rows and columns
    Consistent API: Using the same pattern maintains a consistent interface for all data sources
    Code Reuse: Much of the token extraction logic can be reused
    Familiar Pattern: Developers familiar with the CSV implementation will understand the Excel implementation
    Testing Approach: The detailed testing methodology from CsvReporterTest can be adapted

What Should Be Different

While following the CSV pattern makes sense, you'll need these specific adaptations:

    Replace Parsing Engine: Replace OpenCSV with Apache POI for Excel parsing
    Configuration Options:
    Remove CSV-specific options (separator char, quotation char, escape char)
    Add Excel-specific options (sheet selection if needed)
    Keep common options (header handling, skip rows)
    Data Type Handling: Add special handling for Excel data types (dates, formulas, etc.)

Implementation Recommendations

    Create an ExcelReporter class extending AbstractReporter similar to CsvReporter
    Implement initializeResources() with Apache POI instead of OpenCSV
    Modify the UI to show appropriate Excel-specific options
    Maintain similar method signatures for consistency

Potential Challenges

    Cell Type Conversion: Excel has multiple data types that need consistent string conversion
    Empty Cell Handling: Excel treats empty cells differently than CSV
    Formula Evaluation: Decide if you want to store formula results or formulas themselves

This approach is not flawed - it's actually a good example of following the existing architectural patterns while adapting for format-specific differences. The DDD document also supports this approach with its detailed implementation plan for the Excel datasource.
