
Virgil:

Explain me if I have an Excel file which internaly has a macro which 
connect to a specific database fetched data from the database and 
refreshes this data into thr Excel file itself - can I write a java 
program which fetches the data from the Excel file (this is easy, 
I can use Apache POI for that) but, before fetching the data from 
the Excel file, calls/triggers the existing Excel macro which 
when executing will refresh the Excel data from the database 
thus making sure that whenever we execute our Java program to 
fetch the data from Excel we fetch the latest data because Excel 
itself refreshed its data from the database?

Running Excel Macros from Java Before Data Extraction
Yes, you can write a Java program that triggers an Excel macro to 
refresh data before extracting it with Apache POI. There are 
several approaches to accomplish this:


import java.io.File;

public class ExcelMacroRunner {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            String excelPath = "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\Office16\\EXCEL.EXE";
            String workbookPath = "C:\\path\\to\\your\\file.xlsm";
            String macroName = "RefreshData"; // Your macro name
            
            // Build command to run Excel with macro
            ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder(
                excelPath,
                "/e",
                "/r",
                macroName,
                workbookPath
            );
            
            // Start the process and wait for it to complete
            Process process = pb.start();
            int exitCode = process.waitFor();
            
            if (exitCode == 0) {
                // Now read the updated Excel file with Apache POI
                // POI code here...
            } else {
                System.err.println("Excel process failed with exit code: " + exitCode);
            }
            
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Important Considerations
Excel Installation: Both approaches require Microsoft Excel to be installed on the machine running your Java code
Performance: Opening Excel can be resource-intensive
Security: Excel's macro security settings must allow macro execution
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for Excel crashes or macro failures
Jacob Library: For option 1, you'll need to add the Jacob library to your project dependencies
Headless Environments: These approaches won't work in environments without a UI (like some servers)
If your system has these constraints, consider alternatives like accessing the database directly from Java instead of through Excel.

Virgil:

this approache String workbookPath = "C:\path\to\your\file.xlsm"; - 
how is that I thought the Excel files always have the xslx and 
itnternally some have macros defined in them some do not but they 
always have the same extension xslx - I though that macros inside 
excel files are stored/saved into the same xlxs file - how does that 
work, please explain me

Copilot:

Excel File Extensions and Macro Storage
You've raised an excellent point. Let me clarify how Excel handles macros with different file extensions:

Excel File Extensions
.xlsx - Standard Excel workbook format (XML-based, Office 2007+)
.xlsm - Excel workbook that contains macros ("m" stands for macro-enabled)
.xls - Legacy Excel format (pre-Office 2007, binary format)
.xlsb - Binary Excel workbook that can contain macros
Important Distinctions
Excel files with macros must be saved with the .xlsm extension, not .xlsx. This is a security feature implemented by Microsoft to clearly identify files containing executable code.

If you attempt to save a macro-containing workbook as .xlsx, Excel 
will warn you that all macros will be lost. The .xlsx format is 
specifically designed to not contain executable code.

How Macros Are Stored
In an .xlsm file, macros are stored in a VBA (Visual Basic for 
Applications) project container within the file structure. 
The file itself is actually a ZIP archive with an XML-based structure, 
where the macros are stored in binary format within specific 
components of this archive.

For Your Scenario
When working with Excel files containing macros that connect to databases:

The file must be saved as .xlsm (not .xlsx)
Your Java code should reference this .xlsm file
When the macro runs, it will:
Connect to the database
Fetch the latest data

Update the worksheets within that same .xlsm file

You were right to question this - the file extension in my example should have been .xlsm rather than .xlsx.


-----------------------------

Virgil:

so 1. step 1 - I used process builder to execute test.xlsm given 
"macronName" as argument and when this processed finished 
(hopefully without errors) then 2. Step 2 I know that the data 
inside the test.xlsm was refreshed to be the latest and then 
I use Apache POI to normally read the data from the Excel file 
(which happens to have the extension xslm but for Apache POI this 
doesn not matter it will read the data the same way) - 
is my understanding correct?

Copilot:

Excel Macro Processing and Data Reading with Java
Yes, your understanding is correct! Here's the breakdown of your two-step process:

Step 1: Execute Excel Macro via ProcessBuilder

String excelPath = "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\Office16\\EXCEL.EXE";
String workbookPath = "C:\\path\\to\\test.xlsm";
String macroName = "YourMacroName"; // Your specific macro that refreshes data

// Build command to run Excel with macro
ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder(
    excelPath,
    "/e",
    "/r",
    macroName,
    workbookPath
);

// Start the process and wait for it to complete
Process process = pb.start();
int exitCode = process.waitFor();

if (exitCode != 0) {
    System.err.println("Excel process failed with exit code: " + exitCode);
    return; // Or handle the error appropriately
}

Step 2: Read Updated Data with Apache POI

// Now the test.xlsm file contains refreshed data from the database
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(workbookPath);
XSSFWorkbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook(fis);
XSSFSheet sheet = workbook.getSheetAt(0); // Or getSheet("YourSheetName");

// Read data as normal
// ...

workbook.close();
fis.close();


You're absolutely right that Apache POI handles .xlsm files the same way as .xlsx files for reading purposes. The only difference is in the file's capability to store macros, but the data storage structure is the same.

Just be sure to:

Include error handling for the Excel process
Verify Excel has completely closed before reading the file (to avoid file locking issues)
Ensure your macro includes a save operation before closing Excel

Excel files (with macros) xslm stored in the Cloud Office 365

Virgil:

tell me something Microsoft also offers Excel files in the cloud in 
their Offic365 cloud offering - are these files indenticall with the 
local excel files only that they are stoped on OneDrive or the 
format for the Excel files from the cloud is different vs. local 
Excel files?

Copilot:

Excel Files in Office 365 vs. Local Excel Files
The Excel files stored in Microsoft's Office 365 cloud (OneDrive or SharePoint) use identical file formats to local Excel files. The key points:

File Format Consistency
A .xlsx file in OneDrive has the same internal structure as a .xlsx file on your local drive
A .xlsm file in the cloud contains macros in the same way as a local .xlsm file
The Office Open XML format is used consistently across both environments
Key Differences (Not Format-Related)
While the file formats are identical, there are operational differences:

Access Method: Cloud files can be accessed through web browsers or synchronized locally
Collaboration: Cloud files support real-time co-authoring
Versioning: Cloud storage provides automatic version history
Macro Execution: Important limitation - macros in .xlsm files stored in the cloud:
Can be executed when opened in desktop Excel
Cannot be executed in Excel Online (the browser version)
May have additional security prompts when run from cloud sources
For Your Java Program
If you plan to work with Excel files stored in OneDrive/SharePoint:

You'll need to download the file locally first (using Microsoft Graph API or OneDrive API)
Run the macro locally via the ProcessBuilder approach
Upload the updated file back to the cloud if needed
The approach with ProcessBuilder would work the same way once you have the file locally available, as the file format remains consistent regardless of where it's stored.

but Excel files with macrons inside xslm files can existi in the cloud and, and make sense to executed them in the cloud and for instance such a macro most likely when executed will connect to a "cloud database" and then when I'll download the same Excel file locally and try to execute the same macro most likely it will fail because (most likely) the cloud database is not accesible anymore from the local desktop - I am correct in believing this?

 Excel Cloud Macros and Database Connectivity Issues
You're absolutely correct! This is an important practical consideration when working with Excel files containing macros that connect to databases.

Cloud vs. Local Database Connectivity
When an Excel file (.xlsm) with macros exists in the cloud:

Connection String Context: The macro likely contains connection strings designed for the cloud environment
Network Accessibility: Cloud-based Excel can access:
Public cloud databases (Azure SQL, AWS RDS, etc.)
Private databases within the same corporate network/VPN
Databases specifically configured for cloud service access
Problems When Downloaded Locally
When you download and run the same Excel file locally:

Network Boundary Issues:

Cloud databases might be behind firewalls that block external access
Connection strings with internal cloud addresses won't resolve locally
VPN requirements might differ
Authentication Problems:

Cloud environment might use SSO or managed identities
Local execution might require different credentials
Connection String Format:

Cloud connection might use specific formats/endpoints not valid locally

Example Scenario

// Cloud Excel macro connection string (works in cloud)
"Server=internal-cloud-db.company.intranet;Database=ReportDB;Trusted_Connection=Yes;"

// When run locally, this internal address doesn't resolve

Solutions
If you need to handle this scenario:

Create environment-aware macros with connection string alternatives
Use VPN to ensure network connectivity matches
Modify your Java program to update connection strings before execution
Consider a direct database connection from Java instead of using Excel as middleware
This is a common enterprise challenge when working with Excel files across cloud/local boundaries.
