artificial-intelligence TIPS

    

**Tips** 

1. Go to <a href="https://create.microsoft.com/en-us/search?query=business" target="_blank">**Microsoft Create**</a> and browse even more templates for your business reports (take screenshots of what you like).
2. Upload your report template screenshots to a capable LLM. Request a detailed natural language description or an HTML page that 
    accurately replicates the template, then apply the prompt1 or prompt2 technique outlined below.
3. Go to <a href="https://color.adobe.com/explore" target="_blank">**Adobe Color Explore**</a> and choose a beautiful document color theme (based on color theory)
