TextArea (example of content is below)

From Show more options only below will be used for Fixed width

Ignore Leading Whitespace (checkbox): This might still be relevant if you want to trim leading whitespace from each field.

These controls should provide a comprehensive and flexible way for users to configure their Fixed Width Text File parser. Adjusting the default values to match common use cases will help users get started quickly and efficiently. If you have more specific requirements or need further details, just let me know! ðŸ˜Š

Which of these are not mandatory so that a fixed with file can be parsed without them?
For parsing a fixed width file, some of the controls are essential, while others are optional. Here's a breakdown of which controls are mandatory and which ones you can do without:

Mandatory Controls:
Field Definitions:

Control: Multi-field configuration table

Reason: Essential to define the structure of the fixed width file, specifying the start and end positions of each field.

Optional Controls:
Text Encoding:

Control: Dropdown menu

Reason: Often defaults to UTF-8. Only necessary if the file uses a different encoding.

Row Delimiter:

Control: Text input

Reason: Fixed width files typically use newlines by default, so this is only needed if the delimiter is different.

Header Row:

Control: Checkbox

Reason: Needed only if the file has a header row to skip or use as field names.

Skip Rows:

Control: Numeric input

Reason: Useful for skipping initial rows, but not mandatory for basic parsing.

Trim Whitespace:

Control: Checkbox

Reason: Helpful for cleaning up data, but not essential for parsing.

Date Format:

Control: Dropdown menu

Reason: Needed only if the file contains date fields that require specific formatting.

Decimal Separator:

Control: Dropdown menu

Reason: Necessary only if the file contains numeric fields with decimals.

Thousand Separator:

Control: Dropdown menu

Reason: Needed only for numeric fields with thousands separators, which is less common in fixed width files.

Summary:
Essential: Field Definitions

Optional: Text Encoding, Row Delimiter, Header Row, Skip Rows, Trim Whitespace, Date Format, Decimal Separator, Thousand Separator.

By focusing on the mandatory Field Definitions control, you can ensure that the parser understands the structure of your fixed width file. The optional controls enhance flexibility and handle specific scenarios, but they're not strictly necessary for basic parsing.
