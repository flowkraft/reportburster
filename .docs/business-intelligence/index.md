# Business Intelligence

Deliver interactive reports and dashboards directly where your users work — in the Self‑Service Portal, dedicated dashboards, or embedded inside any web application.

Turn your data into decisions — quickly and reliably. Create a report, describe what you need in plain language, preview the results, and publish a dashboard or embed a component in just minutes.

You get the precision and flexibility of queries and scripts, but without the pain of writing them yourself. The AI generates the queries and scripts you need — you simply explain your intent and guide it toward the right outcome.

Build, review, publish, automate — and trust the results.

### **How to get practical results (step by step)**

**Connect** — Point your report to a data source using the connection UI.  
**Describe** — State what you need (in natural language or via AI prompts); the system proposes a query or script to retrieve and shape the data.  
**Preview & refine** — Inspect rows and KPIs, make adjustments as needed.  
**Visualize** — Add tables, charts, or pivots in the Report UI, or embed components such as `rb-tabulator`, `rb-chart`, or `rb-pivot-table`.  
**Compose & publish** — Assemble dashboards and publish them to the Portal or embed them anywhere.  
**Automate & govern** — Schedule jobs, distribute outputs (PDF/email), and secure everything with API keys and Portal roles.

**Get the precision of code with the simplicity of AI‑assisted authoring — fast, repeatable, and production‑ready.**
