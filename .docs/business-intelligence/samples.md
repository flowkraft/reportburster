# Samples & Cookbooks 🧩

Practical, ready-to-run examples you can clone and adapt.

**Included samples** (v0)
- Sales dashboard — tabulator + chart + pivot (see `sales-summary-*` config files)
- Payslips portal examples — parameter-driven payslip lists and single view
- Invoices2People — publish invoices to portals and allow payments

Where to find sample files: `frend/rb-webcomponents/README.md` lists example config filenames (parameters-spec.groovy, tabulator-config.groovy, chart-config.groovy, pivot-config.groovy).

Next: we’ll add downloadable archives and sample data for each example.
