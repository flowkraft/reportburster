* 1. Overview

** 1.1 What We're Building
A single-page executive dashboard that surfaces the most important financial and
operational KPIs from the invoicing and payslip data. Designed for quick scanning
by management — not deep analysis.

** 1.2 Why
Executives need a 30-second view of business health. They shouldn't have to open
multiple admin pages or run queries. One page, the right numbers, updated in real-time.

* 2. KPI Cards (Top Row)

| KPI              | Source                          | Calculation                              |
|------------------+---------------------------------+------------------------------------------|
| Total Revenue    | invoices where status = paid    | SUM(totalAmount)                         |
| Collection Rate  | paid vs total invoices          | COUNT(paid) / COUNT(all non-draft) * 100 |
| Overdue Amount   | invoices where status = overdue | SUM(totalAmount) + count                 |
| Payroll Disbursed | payslips where status != draft | SUM(netAmount) + count                   |

Each card shows: value, trend vs prior period (% change or absolute delta).

* 3. Charts (Middle Row)

** 3.1 Monthly Invoiced vs Collected (Bar Chart)
- X axis: months (Jan-Jun or last 6 months)
- Two bars per month: invoiced amount (blue), collected amount (green)
- Purpose: visualize the gap between what we bill and what we collect

** 3.2 Invoice Status Distribution (Donut Chart)
- Segments: Paid, Pending (sent), Overdue, Draft
- Center shows collection rate percentage
- Purpose: at-a-glance health of the receivables pipeline

* 4. Tables (Bottom Row)

** 4.1 Top Overdue Invoices
| Column   | Description                        |
|----------+------------------------------------|
| Invoice  | Invoice number (INV-YYYY-NNN)      |
| Customer | Customer name                      |
| Amount   | Total amount owed                  |
| Days Late| Calendar days past due date        |

Show top 5 sorted by days late descending.

** 4.2 Recent Payslips
| Column   | Description                        |
|----------+------------------------------------|
| Payslip  | Payslip number (PS-YYYY-NNN)       |
| Employee | Employee name                      |
| Net Pay  | Take-home amount                   |
| Status   | Sent / Viewed / Downloaded         |

Show last 5 payslips sorted by date descending.

* 5. Data Refresh
- KPIs refresh on page load (server-rendered from database)
- No auto-refresh needed — executives reload when they want fresh data
- API endpoint: GET /api/stats returns all KPI values in one call

* 6. Design Constraints
- One screen, no scrolling on desktop (1920x1080)
- Clean, professional look — not flashy
- Color palette: slate/navy base, blue for invoiced, green for paid, amber for overdue
- Must work on tablet (iPad landscape) for boardroom use
