* 1. Overview

** 1.1 What We're Building
A self-service payslip portal where HR creates and publishes payslips, and employees
view and download their pay documents securely. Each employee sees only their own payslips.

** 1.2 Why
Distributing payslips via email or print is inefficient, insecure, and hard to audit.
A portal gives employees 24/7 access to their pay history while giving HR visibility
into who has viewed and downloaded their payslips.

** 1.3 For Whom
- *HR Administrators* — create payslips, send to employees, track engagement
- *Employees* — view payslip details, download PDF copies

* 2. Data Model
