			I'm concerned with sending misdirected mass email.
		</emphasis>
		</para>
		<para>
			This is a legitimate concern which people might have before deciding
			to implement an automated report delivery system. <emphasis><trademark>DocumentBurster</trademark></emphasis>'s 
			quality assurance mechanism is the tool intended to address exactly this concern, thus greatly reducing the 
			risk and increasing the confidence of doing mass report distribution.

		<para>
			Before going "live" quality assurance should be used for testing
			that everything is configured as it should be.
		</para>
		<para>
			<emphasis><trademark>DocumentBurster</trademark></emphasis> integrates a <emphasis>Test Email Server</emphasis> which sits in the system tray and does not deliver the received messages. 
			The received messages can be quickly viewed and inspected. 
			Imagine you're just about to email 1000 invoices to your customers. 
			You'll want to test your messages before emailing? <emphasis>Email Tester</emphasis> will help you do just that.
		</para>
		<para>	
			The emails that are routed to the <emphasis>Email Tester</emphasis> will include the document(s) as a PDF attachment and the
body of the email messages will be the same which the actual recipients are going to receive.
Once you are comfortable using <emphasis><trademark>DocumentBurster</trademark></emphasis> you can go "live" and distribute the reports to the actual
recipients.

		<title>Error Handling</title>
		<para>
			By default <emphasis><trademark>DocumentBurster</trademark></emphasis> software is stopping 
			the report distribution when an error is happening.
			<emphasis><trademark>DocumentBurster</trademark></emphasis> software will wait for the root cause of the 
			problem to be fixed before triggering again the same report. 
			The reason for this default behavior is that usually the problems are happening because of 
			incorrect (or inconsistent) data and that all of these problems should be promptly fixed 
			otherwise, when ignoring incorrect data (or misconfiguration), bigger problems will probably happen later.
		</para>
		<para>
			Having said that, there are few legitimate situations in which the continuation of 
			the report distribution might be the preferred choice.
			For example, you might be looking at distributing reports to 5000 customers out of which 3 customers have an incorrect
			email address in the database. Maybe the customer data was collected during a long period of time (and by many people) so
			few data problems are expected. In such a case
			you will not be willing to halt all the distribution and instead
			you will need to distribute the reports to all the correct addresses and, 
			in the same time, to get a list with the incorrect email
			addresses which needs to be fixed afterwards.
