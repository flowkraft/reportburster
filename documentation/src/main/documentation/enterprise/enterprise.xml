			Introduction
		</title>
		<para>
			<citetitle>DocumentBurster</citetitle> splits up reports 
			and documents like statements, purchase orders and invoices, 
			reports which are usually generated by applications such as Crystal Reports, 
			SAP, PeopleSoft and Oracle.	The generated burst reports
			are then automatically distributed to various destinations which can be email, SharePoint portal,
			FTP, fax or SMS messages.
		</para>
		<para>
			External applications can send <command><command>burst</command></command> commands
			to <citetitle>DocumentBurster</citetitle> for a single report or for a
			batch of reports which are all coming together. 
			<citetitle>DocumentBurster</citetitle> extracts from the incoming reports
			information like email address or invoice number in order to properly burst and deliver the relevant reports
			to the proper destination.
		</para>
		<para>
			<citetitle>DocumentBurster</citetitle>
			has good report bursting, merging
			and
			distributing capabilities. This
			should be enough when you
			just start
			with reports distribution and you
			usually have
			only few reports to
			burst and distribute monthly. However, if you have more serious reports distribution
			scenarios,
			if
			you are looking for a complete automated process,
			if you
			need advanced
			scheduling capabilities, if you have
			a big number of
			huge reports to be
			distributed to hundreds or even
			thousands of
			customers - in such cases
			you might be
			interested in a tailored
			version of
			<citetitle>DocumentBurster</citetitle>
			.

		<title>Personalized email messages</title>
		<para>
			<citetitle>DocumentBurster</citetitle>
			has support to send both plain text emails and HTML based emails to
			your
			clients.
		</para>
		<para>
			One interesting feature is the
			possibility to define email
			templates based on which you can send
			customized messages to each of
			your partners.
	</para>
		<para>
			For example the following can be an email template:
	</para>
		<para>
			<literallayout>


				Dear <command>$customername$</command>,

					Attached you can find the invoice for the month of <command>$month$</command>.

				Regards,
				Peter
			</literallayout>
		</para>
		<para>
			<command>$customername$</command>
			and
			<command>$month$</command>
			are the variables which will be
			replaced with the relevant
			real values
			when the report is being distributed.
		</para>
		<para>
			This feature is interesting since it allows to define
			only few
			email templates which can be used to send a personalized
			email message
			to each one of your clients.
	</para>
	</sect1>
	<sect1 label="4">
		<title>
			Multiple destination types
		</title>
		<para>
			Different customers might have different preferences
			in how to
			receive
			the reports which you are distributing to them.
			In most of the
			cases
			email is the default medium through which most of
			the people
			prefer to
			get the reports but in some cases FTP might be
			an
			alternative. Some
			customers might have their own automated software
			systems which will
			further process the reports and which might
			expect
			the input reports to
			be placed in a specified remote
			location. Some
			customers might have
			some more strict security
			related requirements
			and because of that will
			require
			the FTPS protocol. In some scenarios
			the generated reports
			should be made directly available to the
			customers
			through some kind of
			an enterprise like portal, such as SharePoint.
			In order to
			support such
			scenarios,
			<citetitle>DocumentBurster</citetitle>
			gives a broad range of out of
			the box destination types such as
			email,
			local files, FTP, FTPs, SFTP
			and TFTP, Windows shared drives
			and UNIX
			Samba servers or WebDAV
			capable servers. On top of the
			enumerated
			protocols, in case you have
			some
			specific requirement, then with the
			help of a plug-in architecture
			custom destination types can be
			implemented and smoothly
			integrated
			into the distribution process.

			Reports distribution server
		</title>
		<para>
			<citetitle>DocumentBurster</citetitle>
			can be deployed as a central report
			distribution
			server. This might be
			useful if you need to have a single
			common place for distributing your
			reports which is concurrently
			accessible to multiple employees from
			your organization.
		</para>
		<para>
			Installed as a central reports distribution server,
			<citetitle>DocumentBurster</citetitle>
			can handle report distribution requests coming from different people
			or from existing
			software systems such as ERP, CRM, HR, Billing or
			Accounting kind of
			business applications. The distributed reports are
			stored in a central
			repository which, if required, can be easily
			managed by adding
			advanced
			indexing and text search capabilities for
			all burst reports.
			Each one of your existing customers can receive
			the
			reports through his preferred medium, being it email,
			FTP or any of
			the other supported destination type.

			Scheduling
		</title>
		<para>
			Scheduling is a common requirement in business applications.
			<citetitle>DocumentBurster Server</citetitle>
			has advanced scheduling capabilities
			which can
			be tailored as per your
			own needs.
			It's easy to schedule reports to
			be
			processed and distributed
			at a specific date and time,
			or to
			distribute them hourly, daily,
			weekly, or monthly
			or set up your own
			frequencies, every other day,
			third Monday of the month, and so on.
		</para>
		<para>
			Scheduling can help you to automate the reports distribution
			flow. Usually the reports should be distributed to your
			clients based
			on a business schedule. Instead of you having
			to remember each day
			which reports should be distributed to whom,
			you can use the
			scheduling capability to automate the distribution
			process.
	</para>
		<para>
			<citetitle>DocumentBurster Server</citetitle>
			has powerful scheduling capabilities.
			Distribution jobs are scheduled
			to run when a given event occurs. Events can be
			defined with nearly
			any combination of the following directives:

		<title>Integration with your existing business software</title>
		<para>
			<citetitle>DocumentBurster</citetitle>
			, when running as a server, can expose remote
			report distribution
			services which can be consumed and
			automated from
			your existing CRM or
			ERP kind
			of business applications.
			<citetitle>DocumentBurster</citetitle>
			can expose the
			remote services in various standards
			depending on your
			exact requirements.
			For example EJB services can be
			exposed if you need
			to automate
			the process from a java client
			program, or web-services can
			be an
			option if you are looking to use a
			non Java program as a client.

			Process and distribute any kind of report
		</title>
		<para>
			Out of the box <citetitle>DocumentBurster</citetitle>
			can process PDF reports.
			In real life, you
			might need to process Word
			reports, Excel Reports,
			OpenOffice reports
			or your own in-house
			reports.
			On demand,
			<citetitle>DocumentBurster</citetitle>
			can burst
			and process any kind of
			report types with the help of an
			initial
			<command>step</command>
			which is first converting all the non PDF reports to the standard PDF
			format.

			Full-featured reports text search engine
		</title>
		<para>
			On demand,
			<citetitle>DocumentBurster Server</citetitle>
			can provide advanced storing,
			indexing and search capabilities for the
			reports
			which you are
			distributing. This is useful if you burst and
			distribute
			many
			reports
			each month and after few months you will finish
			with a huge number of
			documents which needs to be properly managed.
			Simply said, using the
			indexing and search capability will allow
			you to
			quickly find a report
			which was distributed one year ago,
			even if each
			month you distribute
			a lot of reports.

		<title>Scalability and high throughput</title>
		<para>
			<citetitle>DocumentBurster</citetitle>
			is able to process really big reports.
			Just give it a try and you
			might be surprised.
		</para>
		<para>
			However, if you are looking to process a large
			number of reports
			and you have a limited timeframe in
			which the processing should
			happen, in this case you need
			to go for parallel processing of your
			reports.	
	</para>
		<para>
			<citetitle>DocumentBurster Server</citetitle>
			has a good load balancing mechanism which
			helps you to achieve the
			highest throughput possible.
			It is possible to start multiple
			instances
			or the report distribution server application,
			with these
			instances being started on the same physical machine
			or distributed
			across your network. Using load balancing
			mechanisms the report
			distribution work
			will be properly distributed across all the started
			instances.
		</para>
		<para>
			<citetitle>DocumentBurster</citetitle>
			load balancing is quite flexible and can be configured
			depending on
			the types of reports you are processing and also depending
			on the
			hardware resources which are available, so that the
			maximum report
			processing throughput will be achieved
			for your given reality.
		</para>
		<para>
			For example, you might have a situation where you need to process a
			lot
			of reports which are not in the PDF format.
			<citetitle>DocumentBurster</citetitle>
			is processing such reports with an additional
			initial step which is
			converting those reports to PDF. This conversion
			is a resource hungry
			process and you might see that in order
			to have a
			<citetitle>continuous flow</citetitle>
			you need to allocate two times more
			hardware resources for PDF
			conversion than for the other
			report distribution activities such as
			merging, splitting and distributing.
			<citetitle>DocumentBurster</citetitle>
			load balancing can be configured to support such
			a scenario by having
			two times more instances of the application
			dedicated
			for PDF
			conversion than to other activities.
		</para>
		<para>
			Each
			<citetitle>DocumentBurster</citetitle>
			deployment has a different
			reality with different types of reports to
			process and
			with different hardware resources available. Because of
			the previous the
			load balancing mechanism was designed to
			be flexible
			enough to accommodate most of the situations.
		</para>
		<sect2 id="priority">
			<title>Priority based reports processing</title>
			<para>
				One feature of the load balancing mechanism is that it can be
				configured such that the reports will be processed based on
				priorities defined by you. For example you can define two categories
				for your reports tagged as
				<command>high importance</command>
				reports and
				<command>normal importance</command>
				reports.
				<citetitle>DocumentBurster</citetitle>
				can be configured to start processing
				of the reports based on the
				priorities and even more you
				can start dedicated application
				instances to handle your
				<command>high importance</command>
				reports. This will allow processing
				of your reports in a continuous
				flow without having your important
				reports processing delayed because
				of the many usual reports which
				also needs
				to be processed.

		<title>Reports encryption</title>
		<para>
			When handling important financial reports, encrypting the
			distributed
			documents with a password might be an interesting
			feature
			for you.
			<citetitle>DocumentBurster</citetitle>
			supports encryption of the distributed
			reports with password so that a
			user/customer must specify
			the
			password to open the PDF document in
			Adobe Reader or Acrobat.
			Encryption is commonly used to prevent
			unauthorized viewing,
			printing, editing,
			copying text from the document
			and doing

		</para>
		<para>
			With
