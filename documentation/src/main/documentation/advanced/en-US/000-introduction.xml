		<para>
			From
			time to time, some report distribution requirements might
			need to
			execute
			an external program during the report bursting
			lifecycle,
			distribute SMS messages, upload
			reports to enterprise
			portals, send
			reports by Fax or to print the output burst reports. In
			other
			situations it
			might be
			required to upload the reports using more
			secure protocols
			such as FTPs, SFTP or SCP.
			Before sending the reports,
			it is
			also possible
			to encrypt the output reports
			or stamp the
			distributed
			reports in much
			the same way that it is
			applied a rubber
			stamp
			to a paper
			document.

			scripting

		<para>
			If required,

		<para>
			While it might look like an overkill to write
			scripts for doing
			report
			distribution, it is actually a powerful
			and
			flexible
			approach for implementing very specific requirements.
			Furthermore the default
			<emphasis>
				<trademark>DocumentBurster</trademark>
			</emphasis>
			software package is coming with a set of already written
			scripts
			which
			can be used almost out of the box.
		</para>
		<para>
			In most of the real
			life
			situations, just taking
			an existing script
			(appropriate for the
			task
			in hand) and doing very small adjustments (for
			example giving
			FTP host, user name and password) will be all
			that is
			required to
			achieve complex requirements.

			<citetitle>cURL</citetitle>

			uploading,
			HTTP form
