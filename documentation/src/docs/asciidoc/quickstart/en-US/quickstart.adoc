= _DocumentBurster_(C) in 5 Minutes

This document will help you start using _DocumentBurster_(C) in few minutes.

== Introduction

This quick start document will demonstrate how to use _DocumentBurster_(C) software. +

For details on how to install and use _DocumentBurster Server_(C) please read here +

https://www.pdfburst.com/docs/html/userguide/chapter.server.html[window=_blank]

=== Convention - Path Separator

This document uses the slash character (/) to display directory and file components of a path. +

_Windows(R)_ can accept either the backslash (\) or slash (/) characters to separate directory and 
file components of a path, while the Microsoft convention is to use a backslash (\). +

_DocumentBurster_(C) is intended to work on multiple operating systems (e.g. _Windows(R)_, Linux) and the 
convention for this manual is to use the slash character (/) to display the components of a path.

== Download _DocumentBurster_(C)

First step is to download _documentburster.zip_ and extract the file to a hard disk folder location like _C:/_ +

https://s3.amazonaws.com/documentburster/newest/documentburster.zip[window=_blank] +

== Prerequisite

=== Java Runtime (JRE)

Java runtime (JRE) version 1.8 or higher must be installed on the target computer in order to use _DocumentBurster_(C)
software.

=== Check Java version

In the _Windows(R)_ command prompt type *_java –version_* and this command will return the version of Java which is installed on the machine. It should be greater or equal to version 1.8

Otherwise, if you need to install Java, the Java JRE can be downloaded from +

http://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/8 (make sure you download the Java binaries for your operating system, e.g. _Windows(R)_) +

Double-click on the Java downloaded file to start the installation process.

=== #Note on Java#

This is required only if the *_java –version_* command does not return a correct Java version and you know that Java is installed on the computer. +

On _Windows(R)_ sometimes the *_java –version_* command does not return a correct Java version even if Java is installed. This is happening because the _Windows(R)_
*_PATH_* system environment variable does not reflect the location to Java's
_bin_ folder path.

*Solution* (for _Windows(R)_ Server / _Windows(R)_ 10 / _Windows(R)_ 7)

. Open _Control Panel_ - > _System properties_ (WinKey + Pause) dialog.
Select _Advanced_	tab and then _Environment Variables_
. Make sure that the _Windows(R)_ *_PATH_* system environment variable is
updated to include the path to Java's _bin_ folder path location, e.g.
_C:/Program Files/Java/jre8/bin_ or similar should be in the *_PATH_* system environment	variable. Be sure to omit any quotation marks around the path even if it contains	spaces.
. In the _Windows(R)_ command prompt type again the *_java –version_* command. It should return a Java v1.8+ installation.

== Burst a Sample _Payslips.pdf_ Document

Java is now installed which means that you are ready to run _DocumentBurster.exe_

image::documentburster.png[]

_DocumentBurster_(C) is coming with a three pages _Payslips.pdf_ document which is located in the _samples_ folder. Bursting this report will generate three output PDF documents for the three distinct employees which are found in the  _Payslips.pdf_ input report.

The software can be configured to email the individual payslips to the
corresponding employees. Similarly, _DocumentBurster_(C) can be configured to process other report types such as invoices, statements, purchase orders, commissions reports or dunning letters in order to distribute relevant parts to each of your clients, subscribers, partners or vendors.

Please check the _samples/Payslips.pdf_ report to see how the burst tokens are defined using the employees email addresses delimited by the curly brackets { and } characters.
