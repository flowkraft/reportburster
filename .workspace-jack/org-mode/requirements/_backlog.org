--------------------

**AIDER**

**STEP-1**: I discuss my needs with aider4, the project owner. He assesses whether they involve new features, 
a change request (CR), or internal technical refactoring with no externally visible changes. 
Based on his evaluation, he passes the results to aider1, marking the transition to STEP0.

When I make no requests and the system remains idle, aider1 (architect Claude 3.7) addresses the "technical debt" backlog. 
He runs, checks, and reviews Jacobo/cobertura, ESLINT, and Compdoc reports. He selects the next most critical item and 
begins working on it, aiming to identify or reorganize tasks in the backlog for maximum efficiency and impact.

**STEP0**: Aider1 (architect Claude 3.7) decides whether the task requires light refactoring or a heavy, complex effort. 
This decision establishes whether light or heavy planning is necessary.

**Light Planning**
- Aider1 (Sonnet 3.7) formulates the plan.
- Aider2 (Sonnet 3.5) writes the code and conducts the tests.

**Heavy Task/Heavy Planning**
1. Initially:
   - RA.Aid "Deepseek R1" operates in "research" mode using requirements as input. Without involving an aider, it analyzes 
   the full RB backend/frontend/ASBL code to produce research findings.
   - RA.Aid "Deepseek R1" switches to "plan" mode, using the requirements as input along with the previously generated 
   "research" report. It independently works on the full RB backend/frontend/ASBL code to create the RA.Aid R1 plan.

2. Subsequently:
   - Aider1 (architect Claude 3.7) utilizes requirements and the "R1 research" report as input, working in "ask mode" over the 
   complete RB backend/frontend/ASBL code to produce the "Sonnet Aider1" plan.
   - Aider2 (architect Google Gemini 2.5) also operates in "ask mode," using the same inputs to generate the 
   "Gemini Aider2" plan.

3. All other architects, along with aider3 (code/editor), evaluate one another's previously created plans. 
They base their assessments on requirements and general guidelines for creating a quality plan, ensuring all plans 
are thoroughly reviewed.

4. Architect Claude 3.7 consolidates the evaluations, including grades, comments, and requirements, into a refined plan.

5. Aider3 (code/editor Claude-3-5-Sonnet-20241022, scoring 92.1%/91.0%) writes the code.

**Completion**
Aider4 (project owner) performs the complete end-to-end suite and acceptance tests. Once all tests pass 100%, the sprint 
is officially closed.

What This Structure Provides
This structure creates a unified environment where heterogeneous applications (different technologies, languages, and purposes) can coexist while:

Maintaining Isolation: Each app operates independently with its own configuration and runtime
Enabling Integration: Apps can communicate through defined interfaces
Sharing Resources: Common authentication, data sources, and other resources can be shared
Centralized Management: All apps controlled through a single management interface
Real-World Examples
Auth Providers Integration

// _apps/_integrations/auth-providers/keycloak/manifest.json
{
  "id": "keycloak-auth",
  "name": "Keycloak SSO Provider",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "auth-provider",
  "config": {
    "realm": "reportburster",
    "auth-server-url": "http://localhost:8080/auth",
    "resource": "reportburster-client",
    "public-client": true
  },
  "interfaces": {
    "login": "/api/auth/login",
    "logout": "/api/auth/logout",
    "verify": "/api/auth/verify"
  }
}



In this example, the Keycloak authentication provider allows:

A user to login once to their HR portal
That same authentication is used across all ReportBurster apps
The user can access their payslips in the Next.js portal and schedule reports in Flowkraft without logging in again
Data Connectors Integration


// _apps/_integrations/data-connectors/sql-server/manifest.json
{
  "id": "sql-server-connector",
  "name": "SQL Server Data Connector",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "data-connector",
  "config": {
    "connection-string": "jdbc:sqlserver://server:1433;databaseName=HR;",
    "driver": "com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver",
    "pool-size": 10
  },
  "datasets": {
    "employees": "SELECT * FROM Employees",
    "departments": "SELECT * FROM Departments",
    "payslips": "SELECT * FROM Payslips WHERE employee_id = ?"
  }
}

This connector allows:

Multiple apps to access the same HR database
The Next.js portal shows employee information
Flowkraft generates payslips using the same data source
ReportBurster distributes those payslips through email


Registry.json Explained

ReportBurster Extensions: Multiple Deployment Options
Yes, this architecture is designed to be highly flexible with multiple deployment and development options:

1. Docker-Compose Management
You can absolutely use docker-compose as the primary management tool:

# Start all applications
cd _apps
docker-compose -f cms-portals/next/docker-compose.yml -f flowkraft/docker-compose.yml up -d

# Stop specific application
cd _apps/cms-portals/next
docker-compose down

The registry.json already includes docker-compose commands as entrypoints, and the management scripts in bin/ simply wrap these commands with additional orchestration logic.

Benefits:

Isolated dependencies and environments
Consistent deployment across systems
Easy port/network management between components
Works well for heterogeneous applications (Next.js + Grails)

2. Direct JVM Execution
Since ReportBurster already requires Java, you can run JVM-based components directly:

# Start Flowkraft directly with JVM
cd _apps/flowkraft
./bin/flowkraft.jar -Dgrails.env=prod

# Or through the management script
../../bin/start-flowkraft.bat --mode=jvm

The architecture supports this through:

"entrypoint": {
  "start": {
    "docker": "docker-compose up -d",
    "jvm": "java -jar flowkraft.jar"
  }
}

Configuration setting in registry.json to select mode:

"preferences": {
  "execution-mode": "jvm"  // or "docker"
}

Benefits:

Lower overhead (no containerization)
Direct file system access
Easier debugging
Works better in environments without Docker

3. Full Grails Development Environment
Yes, Flowkraft is designed as a complete Grails development environment with:

_apps/flowkraft/
├── plugins/
│   ├── _core/           # Core system plugins 
│   ├── jobson/          # Job management plugin
│   ├── quartz-web/      # Scheduler UI plugin
│   └── my-custom-crm/   # Your custom plugin
└── development/         # Development resources
    ├── plugin-templates/
    └── api-docs/

Live Code Reloading

    The system supports full development mode:

    Auto-detection of plugins:

    Place your custom plugin (e.g., CRM) in the plugins directory
    Flowkraft will detect it on startup
    Live reloading:

    Start in development mode: start-flowkraft.bat --dev
    Edit Groovy/GSP files in your plugin directory
    Changes are detected and reloaded without restart
    Development tools:

    Grails interactive console
    H2 web console for database access
    Plugin templates for quick starts

    Example: Adding a Custom CRM Plugin

        # Copy the plugin template
        cp -r _apps/flowkraft/development/plugin-templates/basic _apps/flowkraft/plugins/my-crm

        # Edit the plugin files
        cd _apps/flowkraft/plugins/my-crm
        code .

        # Flowkraft detects and loads the plugin automatically when running in dev mode
        ../../bin/flowkraft.bat dev

This approach gives you the best of both worlds - containerized deployment for production, with full development capabilities for customization.

Recommendation
  Based on your extension system in the registry.json, I recommend:

  Use Keycloak as a dedicated auth service from the beginning

  Deploy it as a containerized service in _apps/_integrations/auth-providers/keycloak
  Configure it to use LDAP as the user store
  Set it to auto-start in the registry preferences
  Implement the user/role UI in Flowkraft as planned

  But have it use Keycloak's Admin REST API
  This keeps the user-facing management in Flowkraft
  Without making Flowkraft a dependency for authentication
  This approach gives you:

  No single point of failure for authentication
  Clear separation of concerns
  Standards-based OAuth/OIDC
  Still allows Flowkraft to provide the user management UI

Keycloak's Built-in User Management UI

  Yes, Keycloak comes with a comprehensive administration console that provides full user and group management 
  functionality out of the box:

User Management Features
  Complete CRUD operations for users
  Password management and reset
  User search with filtering
  User attributes and metadata
  Session management
  User impersonation for testing

Group Management
  Create/edit/delete groups
  Hierarchical group structures
  Add/remove users from groups
  Assign group-level roles and permissions
  Group attributes

Role-Based Access Control
  Define realm and client-specific roles
  Role assignment to users and groups
  Composite roles (roles that include other roles)
  Role mappings
