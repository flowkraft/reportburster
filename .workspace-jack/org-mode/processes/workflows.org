* Requirements Management Workflow
** Purpose
Document the process for managing requirements documents from creation to implementation

** Workflow Steps
1. Requirements Document Creation
   - Created in: .workspace-jack/org-mode/requirements/
   - File naming: requirements-YYYYMMDD-vX.X.X.org
   
2. Approval Process
   - Add approval section to document header
   - Move to in-progress folder after approval
   - Update status to "Approved"

3. Developer Access
   - Developers copy from in-progress folder to their workspace
   - Maintain read-only access to original document

4. Implementation Tracking
   - Add implementation status for each requirement
   - Track progress through status updates

5. Post-Implementation
   - Move to implemented folder
   - Add cross-references to related documentation
   - Update requirements index

** Roles and Responsibilities
- Product Owner: Creates initial requirements
- CEO: Approves requirements
- Developers: Implement requirements
- QA: Verify implementation

* Detailed Design Document (DDD) Workflow
** Purpose
Document the process for creating and using Detailed Design Documents (DDDs) to guide implementation of requirements.

** Workflow Steps
1. DDD Creation
   - After requirements approval, create a Detailed Design Document (DDD) for each requirement
   - Store DDDs in: .workspace-<developer>/org-mode/design/
   - File naming: ddd-YYYYMMDD-<requirement-name>.org

2. DDD Structure
   - Each DDD should include:
     - Requirement Description: Brief summary of the requirement
     - Implementation Prompts: Detailed prompts for the LLM and/or human developer
     - Files to Modify: List of files to update or create
     - Code Snippets: Examples of existing code and expected changes
     - Acceptance Criteria: Clear criteria to verify implementation

3. Implementation
   - Use the DDD as a guide for implementation
   - Update the DDD with implementation status and notes during development

4. Review and Validation
   - Share the DDD with the team for review before final implementation
   - Ensure the implementation meets the acceptance criteria

5. Post-Implementation
   - Move the DDD to the implemented folder
   - Add cross-references to the DDD in the requirements document

** Roles and Responsibilities
- Developers: Create and update DDDs
- LLM: Assist with implementation based on DDD prompts
- QA: Validate implementation against DDD acceptance criteria
