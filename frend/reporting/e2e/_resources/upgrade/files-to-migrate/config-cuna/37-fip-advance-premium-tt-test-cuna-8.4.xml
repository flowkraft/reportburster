      <text>Dear FIP Policy Holder, 
In an effort to improve our service to your organization and its members, we are requesting your assistance in confirming the status of the terminated certificates listed in the attachment, for which premiums continued to be received on account after the certificate was terminated by CUNA.
Kindly confirm for each certificate, which should be reinstated, because the credit union has the additional premiums required to bring these certificates paid thru dates current. Instructions to reinstate must be received along with a copy of the member’s statement showing the member had been consistently making payment to his or her FIP certificate. Alternatively please advise which certificates should remain cancelled and as such the aggregated premiums will be refunded. 
This will allow for the accurate update of member accounts on our systems, which will be reflected in the monthly billing and expedite the claims approval process. Please note we will not honour any claims incurred on a certificate with a terminated status.
We would like to emphasize the importance of also including termination request letters for member certificates with your monthly remittance listing. 
Please update the attached listing with the member account statuses and email same to rsawh@company.com or jbartholomew@company.com by October 12th 2018.
We take this opportunity to thank you for your cooperation and support, and look forward to continue serving you, our Policyholder and your members.
Best regards,
