/**
 * The ONE catch for the Spring Boot REST server.
 *
 * <h2>Exception handling philosophy</h2>
 * Controllers and services NEVER catch. Every {@code Throwable} propagates up
 * the request chain and lands here — the single {@code @RestControllerAdvice}
 * for the app. This handler does three things:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>log the full stack trace via SLF4J — the {@code com.flowkraft} logger
 *       is wired to both the Console appender (stdout) and the error-out
 *       appender ({@code errors.log}), so every unhandled exception is
 *       visible in the server console AND persisted to disk with the
 *       offending HTTP method + path as a prefix;</li>
 *   <li>return HTTP 500 with a compact JSON body ({@code {"error": "..."}})
 *       so the client gets a structured response instead of Spring's default
 *       HTML error page;</li>
 *   <li>the server process keeps running — unlike a CLI, a long-lived REST
 *       server must survive one bad request and serve the next one cleanly.</li>
 * </ol>
 * This mirrors the discipline in {@code bkend/reporting}'s
 * {@link com.sourcekraft.documentburster.DocumentBurster} — single
 * top-level handler, full stack on every exception — but DocumentBurster
 * rethrows (because the JVM is about to exit after the run), whereas this
 * handler returns a {@code ResponseEntity} (because the JVM must stay alive).
 * Same philosophy, different termination semantics.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> this is the DEFAULT general approach, not an absolute rule.
 * A handful of scattered {@code catch} blocks still exist across controllers,
 * services, and schedulers, and each remaining one is there for a specific
 * reason:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Business-logic-justified</b> — the catch site is where the
 *       recovery/fallback actually belongs (e.g. {@code DockerService}'s
 *       "Docker not installed → mark unavailable and continue"; a probe that
 *       must return a safe default when the target resource is missing;
 *       a best-effort cleanup that must not mask the original failure);</li>
 *   <li><b>Technical obligation</b> — background schedulers
 *       ({@code PollScheduler}, {@code JobExecutionService},
 *       {@code StarterPacksManagementService}) run outside the HTTP request
 *       lifecycle, so {@code @RestControllerAdvice} never fires for them and
 *       they MUST catch locally (still logging with the full stack via
 *       {@code log.error("...", e)} — never just {@code e.getMessage()}).
 *       Similarly, framework callback signatures sometimes don't allow
 *       propagation across the boundary.</li>
 * </ul>
 * No {@code catch} block should exist just because leaving one in was the
 * path of least resistance. Every surviving catch needs to be justifiable
 * under one of the two rules above; if it isn't, delete it and let the
 * exception reach this handler.
 *
 * <p>Such exceptions to the rule should be <b>very few and genuinely
 * exceptional</b> — if you find yourself reaching for a catch in new code,
 * assume the default rule applies and push back hard on any attempt to
 * introduce another one. The further this codebase drifts from "one catch
 * per layer", the harder it becomes to see what actually went wrong.
