DATA MODEL:
A companion script (Groovy or SQL) prepares the data. Data source is JRMapCollectionDataSource — flat rows from a Map (no JDBC).
- All fields must be declared as java.lang.Object.
- SIMPLE REPORTS (one row = one document): all data is directly available on the single row. Use the title band for the full layout — it can access fields from the first (and only) row.
- MULTI-ROW / MASTER-DETAIL REPORTS: data is pre-flattened (master fields duplicated on every child row). A companion script can add separate "virtual rows" for totals/footers with a row_type field. The .jrxml uses printWhenExpression on elements to show different layouts per row_type — all within a SINGLE detail band.

FORMAT RULES (JR 7.0.x / Jackson XML):
- Do NOT add xmlns or xsi:schemaLocation on <jasperReport> — JR7 does not use them.
- Do NOT use expressionBackcolor (unsupported in 7.0.x). For alternating row colors use two overlapping rectangles with printWhenExpression.
- Do NOT declare a REPORT_CONNECTION parameter.
- No subreports — single file only.
- Band heights must fit within pageHeight minus topMargin minus bottomMargin.
- All elements that go beyond the declared band height cause a compile-time validation error — every element must fit within its band.

CRITICAL JR 7 + JRMapCollectionDataSource RULES:
- Fields are NULL outside the primary detail band. Do NOT use summary band, columnFooter, lastPageFooter, group footer, or second detail bands for displaying field values — they will always be empty.
- Do NOT use <variable> elements (calculation="First", "Nothing", sticky patterns) to carry values into post-detail bands — they also fail with JRMapCollectionDataSource.
- Do NOT wrap conditional elements in a <frame> with printWhenExpression — fields inside the frame will be null. Instead, put each element directly in the band with its own individual printWhenExpression.
- java.lang.Object fields do NOT render as text. Always use string concatenation to force toString(): write `"" + $F{myField}` or `"Label: " + $F{myField}`, never bare `$F{myField}` in a textField expression.
- Only the title band and the detail band can safely access field values. Everything else sees null.

ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS:

Pattern A — SIMPLE REPORT (one row = one document, e.g., a letter, certificate, single-record form):
- Put the entire layout in the title band. All fields are available from the single data row.
- Use the detail band only if you need repeating sections.

Pattern B — MULTI-ROW REPORT with totals (e.g., invoice, order, statement):
- Title band: report header, company logo, bill-to info (fields from first row).
- Single detail band (fixed height, e.g., 24px) with row_type routing:
  1. Normal data rows (row_type == null): line items with product, qty, price, etc.
  2. Totals rows (row_type == "totals_line"): label + value right-aligned in table columns.
  3. Grand total row (row_type == "total_due"): bold label + value with colored background.
  4. Footer row (row_type == "footer"): notes, signatures, thank-you message.
- All within ONE <detail><band> — no summary, no second band, no frames.
- The script emits totals/footer as separate data rows after the line items.
